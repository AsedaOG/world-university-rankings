README: World Universities Rankings Analysis
 
Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the rankings of world universities from 2016 to 2024. Utilizing data from Kaggle and visualizing it with Tableau, this project aims to understand how different variables such as student population, international student distribution, teaching quality, and research environment contribute to university rankings.
 
Project Structure
•	Project Summary:
o	Outlines the significance of understanding university rankings for decision-making, benchmarking, reputation enhancement, resource allocation, and policy development.
•	Working with Tableau:
o	Discusses the use of Tableau for connecting to diverse data sources, creating interactive visualizations, and developing dashboards.
•	Data Connection:
o	Details on how the data, spanning from 2016 to 2024, was sourced from Kaggle for analysis.
•	Data Selection:
o	Focuses on selecting relevant data for analyzing and ranking top universities.
•	Analysis Questions:
o	Key questions driving the analysis:
1.	Which university has the highest student population?
2.	Which countries have the most international student population?
3.	How are overall university scores influenced by teaching, research, etc.?
4.	How has student population growth changed over the years?
5.	What are the specific statistics for Canadian universities?
•	Types of Graphs:
o	Descriptions of various charts used for analysis, including:
1.	Bar Chart: Top 10 countries by international student population.
2.	Line Chart: Rank changes of top 10 universities over time.
3.	Treemap: Overall scores of top ten universities.
4.	Linear Trend Line: Relationship between research quality and overall scores.
